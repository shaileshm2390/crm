Alright now the fun begins. First clone or download the repo to your computer.

Clone the repository git clone git@github.com:jpotts18/mean-stack-relational.git.

Go into the repository cd mean-stack-relational/.

Install dependencies with NPM npm install. 
This will copy development.json5, and production.json5 from respective sample files in the config/env folder and run the grunt copy task to copy frontend lib files to their destination.

Plug in your private and public keys for working with FB and Twitter into /config/env/development.json5 and/or /config/env/production.json5.

Wire up the database connection found in /config/env/development.json5 and/or /config/env/production.json5.

Run in production mode with: pm2 start pm2-ecosystem.json --env production (Run sudo npm install -g pm2 if it's not installed.), or
Run in development mode with grunt: grunt

Make something awesome!
Thats all! Now go and open up your browser at http://localhost:3000, and tweet @jpotts18 to say thanks!
